# Path Visualizer

This project is designed to help you visualize and find the shortest path between two points on a grid using Dijkstra's Algorithm.

## Getting Started

1. **Selecting Start and End Nodes:**
   - Click on a single cell to choose the Start node.
   - Click on another cell to set the End node.

2. **Adding Walls:**
   - Press the "Draw Wall" button.
   - Click and drag on the grid to add walls.
   - Walls are obstacles that the algorithm will navigate around to find the shortest path.

## How to Run

## Features

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Utilizes Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path between the selected Start and End nodes.
- **Priority Queue:** Implemented priority queue in Javascript, being used by the algorithm
- **Interactive Grid:** Click to set Start and End nodes, and draw walls to customize the environment.
- **Visualization:** Watch as the algorithm visualizes its exploration and identifies the shortest path.
- **Clear Grid:** Start fresh by clearing the grid with the "Reset" button.
